# Matrix Rain Effect with Varying Font Sizes and Dimming Effect

This Python script creates a Matrix rain effect similar to the iconic scene from "The Matrix" movie. The code uses Pygame library to render the effect on the screen. The rain effect consists of characters falling vertically, with varying font sizes and a dimming effect to create a sense of depth.

Features:
- Randomly generated characters from a combination of Japanese and Latin letters.
- Characters change dynamically during the animation.
- Font sizes vary randomly for each column, creating a 3D effect.
- Smaller font sizes appear dimmer, adding depth to the effect.
- Automatic addition and removal of rain columns to limit visual clutter.
- Smooth animation with adjustable frame rate.

Usage:
1. Make sure you have Python and Pygame library installed on your system.
2. Download the "matrixcode_nfi.ttf" font file and place it in the same directory as the script. You can use this font freely for non commercial purposes per the author.
3. Run the script and enjoy the Matrix rain effect!
